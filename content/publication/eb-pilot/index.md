abstract: "Most disease-associated loci, though located in putatively regulatory regions, have not yet been confirmed to affect gene expression. One reason for this could be that we have not examined gene expression in the most relevant cell types or conditions. Indeed, even large-scale efforts to study gene expression broadly across tissues are limited by the necessity of obtaining human samples post-mortem, and almost exclusively from adults. Thus, there is an acute need to expand gene regulatory studies in humans to the most relevant cell types, tissues, and states. We propose that embryoid bodies (EBs), which are organoids that contain a multitude of cell types in dynamic states, can provide an answer. Single cell RNA-sequencing now provides a way to interrogate developmental trajectories in EBs and enhance the potential to uncover dynamic regulatory processes that would be missed in studies of static adult tissue. Here, we examined the properties of the EB model for the purpose mapping inter-individual regulatory differences in a large variety of cell types."
