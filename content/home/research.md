### For scientists


### For everyone
The goal of my research is to understand how our genetics contribute to complex traits like height, BMI, or disease risk. One common way to study this, taking height for example, is to gather a bunch of people of all kinds of different sizes. 
Then, we can collect information about their DNA; other scientists have done this for all kinds of different traits.
That gives us the information we need to figure out *associations* between certain letters in our DNA, and complex traits. 
Unfortunately, a lot of the time, this isn't too helpful, and the parts of our DNA that are associated with complex traits aren't even in our genes. 
Instead, they're in the huge part of our genome that is noncoding.
