I am a PhD Candidate in [Alexis Battle's lab](https://battlelab.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, in the Department of Biomedical Engineering. My undergraduate training was in Biological Engineering at Cornell University. 

My research focuses on the application of machine learning methods to study at the dynamic landscape of genetic regulation of gene expression. Single-cell technologies
